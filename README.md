## Using JavaScript to display a filtered list of information

The purpose of this analysis is to use JS to retrieve and display a filterable result from a static datasource also from another JS file.

With the code we put together, we have displayed a nice looking formatted, readable webpage:

(((web_page)))

This next image shows the filters that we set up for the Data we were provided.  Each field will take in a free form text and will auto complete once it finds a match from the data for each column.  Enter your search parameters in each empty box with the appropriate parameters, ie.. in the City field, enter a city name etc.  You will not need to use the "Enter" button as I have updated the code to automatically have the script parse the entry as you are inputing the search text.

(((Filter)))

Here is a filtered result using all 5 of the unique fields:

(((filter_results)))

One drawback of this webpage is that the data is static and is limited to a narrow date range.

I would recommend having a link to an online database that can use these filters so more and complete data could be accessed for reference.
I would also recommend adding an export function for the filtered data for future reference.
